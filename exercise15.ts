//Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.
//Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.

// Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.

//• Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list

//step 1. print a name of person who cant make it.

let guestWhoCantMAkeIt: string = "muhammad iqbal"

console.log(`${guestWhoCantMAkeIt} cant make it to dinner`)

//step 2. replace the name of the guest who can make it.
